Front End Mentor Project 2 - Blog Preview Card (Newbie)

This is a challenge for Front End Mentor.  The goal is to copy the provided screenshot of a webpage.  It has a card in the middle of the screen with a description of a blog post about HTML and CSS foundations.  The header also has a hover state.  I will use the skills I've learned so far to try to recreate the image.  I will also follow the provided branding guideline.
