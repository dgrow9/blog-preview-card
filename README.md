Front End Mentor Project 2 - Blog Preview Card (Newbie)

This is a challenge for Front End Mentor.  The goal is to copy the provided screenshot of a webpage.  It has a card in the middle of the screen with a description of a blog post about HTML and CSS foundations.  The card and the header have a hover state.  I will use the skills I've learned so far to try to recreate the image.  I will also follow the provided branding guideline.

Some choices I made:

I used the box model instead of flex box.

I added a mobile version for screens less than 375px.

I added hover elements with :hover.

I used ids instead of classes for div containers because I was only using them once.
